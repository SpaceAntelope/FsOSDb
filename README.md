# FsOSDb
F# partial implementation of the OSDb API (http://www.opensubtitles.org) with command-line interface. 

Additionally you can perform framerate conversions on existing .srt and .ass subtitle files as well as re-sync timestamps.

See *FsOSDb.CLI --help* for details, actual documentation coming soon, hopefully.
